# Installation

### Method 1 - Manual
You can navigate to [releases](https://github.com/evaera/roblox-lua-promise/releases) where you will be able to find recent published releases of the promise lib.

To get the promise file all you need to do is select which version you want to use and click on `assets` and download the `zip` or the `roblox-lua-promise.lua` file, which you can put the contents into a ModuleScript.
